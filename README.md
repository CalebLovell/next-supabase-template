-  Next.js
-  Supabase
-  React Query
-  TypeScript

## Instructions:

1. Fork this repo and clone it locally
2. Create a project on Supabase
3. Copy the file `.env.local.example` and rename it `.env.local`, then replace the values with your Supabase keys

### Based off of: [Supabase authentication](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth) client- and server-side (API routes), and SSR with auth cookie.

This example shows how to use Supabase auth on the client and server in both [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and when using [server side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).
