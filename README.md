# Next Supabase Template with Client and Server Side Auth Using:

- Next.js
- Supabase
- React Query
- TypeScript


## Based off of: [Supabase authentication](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth) client- and server-side (API routes), and SSR with auth cookie.

This example shows how to use Supabase auth on the client and server in both [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and when using [server side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).
